本章內容不討論任何理論的東西，着重強調用 R 進行實際數據的分析，並加強對輸出結果的理解。


此次實戰演練的目的是學會怎樣計算死亡率比 (Rate Ratios, RR)。學會用 Mantel-Haenszel 法總結 RR，並討論其意義。

```{r SME01, cache=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
whitehal <- read_dta("../backupfiles/whitehal.dta")
whitehal$followupyrs <- (whitehal$timeout - whitehal$timein)/365.25
max(whitehal$followupyrs*365.25) # time difference in days
summary(whitehal$followupyrs <- as.numeric(whitehal$followupyrs)) # time difference in years

# categorize agein into groups (40-44, 45-49, 50-54, ... , 65-69)
whitehal$agecat <- cut(whitehal$agein, breaks = seq(40, 70, 5), right = FALSE)
with(whitehal, table(agecat))

# examine how mortality rates change with age at entry
# 
# with(whitehal %>% group_by(agecat) %>%
#   summarise(D = sum(all),
#             Y = sum(followupyrs)),
#   cbind(whitehal$agecat, pois.exact(x = D, pt = Y/1000)))


## rate ratios and 95% CIs for each age category compare with [40,44) age group
Model0 <- glm(all ~ agecat + offset(log(followupyrs)), family = poisson(link = "log"), data = whitehal); ci.exp(Model0)

## The rate ratios are increasing with age although there is no statistical evidence
## at 5% level that the rate among 45-49 year olds is different to the rate among men
## who are <40 years


# with(whitehal %>% group_by(grade) %>%
#   summarise(D = sum(all),
#             Y = sum(followupyrs)),
#   cbind(whitehal$grade, pois.exact(x = D, pt = Y/1000)))

Model1 <- glm(all ~ factor(grade) + offset(log(followupyrs)), family = poisson(link = "log"), data = whitehal); ci.exp(Model1)

## There is strong evidence that the all cause mortality rate differs between high
## and low grade workers.

## To examine whether the estimated RR for grade is confounded by age at entry
## we compare the crude RR =2.31 (1.90, 2.81) with the Mantel-Haenszel summary
## estimate.

whitehal_table <- aggregate(cbind(all, followupyrs) ~ grade + agecat, data=whitehal, sum)
stmh_array <- array(c(4, 20,   693.1284,4225.4893,
                      10,35,   1363.821,6491.072,
                      30,52,  1399.63, 4660.12,                                                        51,67,   1832.169,3449.846,
                      59,42,   1660.597,1434.251,
                      28,5,  316.23840, 79.00879),
                      dim=c(2,2,6),
                      dimnames = list(
                      Grade=c("2","1"),
                      c("death", "Person_years"),
                      Agecat=names(table(whitehal$agecat))
                    ))
stmh_array
mhgrade_age <- epi.2by2(stmh_array, method = "cohort.time", units = 1000)
mhgrade_age


## Overall estimate and Wald 95% confidence intervals,
## controlling for agecate
mhgrade_age$massoc$IRR.mh.wald
mhgrade_age$massoc$chisq.mh ## p-value for age-adjusted MH rate ratio



## The Mantel-Haenszel summary estimate RR = 1.43 (1.16, 1.76).
## The result shows that the crude estimate of the effect of grade was
## partly confounded by age at entry.

## To assess whether there is effect modification betwee grade and
## agecat we examine the stratum specific estimates and assess
## whether there is evidence of important variation between them.
mhgrade_age$massoc$IRR.strata.wald
## The result indicates that the data are compatible with the assumption
## of no interaction/effect modification (p=0.79)

## test for unequal RRs (effect modification):
mhgrade_age$res$RR.homog

## Hence, we do not need to present the stratum-specific estimates.
